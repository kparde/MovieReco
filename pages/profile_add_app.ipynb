    "# Create New Profile\n",
    "**Use Case:** new user without existing profile. Enter movies and ratings so that they can receieve personalized recommendations       \n",
    "Details:\n",
    "- Persistant across session: if come back to page later (without clearing cache), will be on the same profile\n",
    "    - Cannot create a new profile in 1 session. Makes sense because proxying a login experience. \n",
    "- Persistant between sessions: save data so when return to app later, can pull up an old profile. \n",
    "- Add to LISTS instead of dataframes because mutable: persistant across sessions \n",
    "    - Thus can enter ID created in personalization page to get recommendations    \n",
    "- User must add at least 2 DISTINCT ratings, else will produce no recommendations in the recommendation tab \n",
    "    - Because of normalization - rating becomes 0 if only 1 distinct value (mean = self)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Process:\n",
    "- User free text input movie title\n",
    "    - Too many to display as a dropdown. Streamlit crashes\n",
    "- Look for movies in system with > 70% similarity. Display top 10\n",
    "- User selects from dropdown (1 selection only possible)\n",
    "- User input rating and hit submit\n",
    "- If hit view profile & save without 2 distinct ratings (at least 2 movies with 2 different ratings), ask to enter more. \n",
    "- Otherwise, display what they've entered + concat to ratings dataframe and save "
